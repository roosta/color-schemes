Color scripts
---
Huge thanks to [@gstk](https://github.com/gstk). I mainly leeched of his collection: https://github.com/gstk/color-scripts but some
I've found elsewhere. And of course an even bigger thanks to all the original authors! Hopefully most of these scripts contain author info and if not I'll endeavour to add it if available.

```shell
./support  #contains scripts for checking color support.
./formatting #contains scripts what assists with ANSI codes and cterm values.
```
